Feature: Authentication

    As a user, I should be able to sign-in and be redirected accordingly.
    However, if I do not provide adequate credentials, then I will not be redirected.
    Once signed-in, I should be able to sign-out and be redirected to the login page again.

    #Background:
        #Given I navigate to the "login" page
        #Then I should see the "login" page

    Scenario: An authenticated Admin signing in with valid credentials

        Only test the admin since all users should see the same result.
        If the Admin doesn't get the correct result, no user will.

        Given There is a "ADMIN"
        Given I navigate to the "login" page
        Given I am a "ADMIN"
        When I authenticate with valid credentials
        Then I should see the "users" page
        And I sign out
        Then I should see the "login" page
