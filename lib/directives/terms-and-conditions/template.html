        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Dispute Resolution</h2>

            <h3>Agreement to Arbitrate</h3>

            <p>If a Dispute (as defined below) of any kind arises, we want to understand and address your concerns quickly and to your satisfaction. Please contact us in the event of any Dispute. If we cannot resolve your concerns, we agree to an informal and inexpensive dispute resolution process requiring individual arbitration. For the purpose of this Agreement “Disputes” include any claim, controversy, or dispute (whether involving contract, tort, equitable, statutory, or any other legal theory) between you and Krossover including but not limited to any claims relating in any way to this Agreement (including its breach, termination, or interpretation), any other aspect of our relationship, Krossover advertising, and any use of Krossover software or services. “Disputes” also include any claims that arose before this Agreement and that may arise after termination of this Agreement.</p>

            <p>You and Krossover agree to arbitrate all Disputes. Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court and seeks to resolve disputes more quickly. Instead of a judge or a jury, the case will be decided by a neutral arbitrator who has the power to award the same damages and relief that a court can. If any provision of this arbitration agreement is found unenforceable, the unenforceable provision shall be severed, and the remaining arbitration terms shall be enforced. All Disputes shall be resolved finally and exclusively by binding individual arbitration with a single arbitrator administered by the American Arbitration Association (www.adr.org) or JAMS (www.jamsadr.org) according to this provision and the applicable arbitration rules for that forum. The Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16, fully applies. Unless otherwise required by law, any arbitration hearing will occur in New York, New York, U.S.A. The arbitrator’s award shall be binding on the parties and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. If you prevail on any claim for which you are legally entitled to attorney’s fees, you may recover those fees from the arbitrator. For any claim where you are seeking relief, Krossover will not seek to have you pay its attorney’s fees, even if fees might otherwise be awarded, unless the arbitrator determines that your claim was frivolous. For purposes of this arbitration provision, references to you and Krossover also include respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors, successors and assigns as well as authorized users or beneficiaries of Krossover services.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Judicial Forum for Disputes.</h2>

            <p>In the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply, you and Krossover agree that any Dispute will be litigated exclusively in the federal or state courts of New York County, New York, and both parties consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>No Class Actions.</h2>

            <p>ALL DISPUTES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL BE RESOLVED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS. CLASS ARBITRATIONS, CLASS ACTIONS, PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ACTIONS, AND CONSOLIDATION WITH OTHER ARBITRATIONS ARE NOT PERMITTED. YOU ARE WAIVING YOUR RIGHTS TO HAVE YOUR CASE DECIDED BY A JURY AND TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, CONSOLIDATED ACTION OR REPRESNTATIVE ACTION AGAINST US.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Assignment</h2>

            <p>We may assign this contract at any time to any parent, subsidiary, or any affiliated company, or as part of the sale to, merger with, or other transfer of our company to another entity. You may not assign, transfer or sublicense the Terms of Use to anyone else and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.</p>

        </li>

        <li>

            <h2>Eligibility</h2>
